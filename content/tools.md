# Tools For Diagnostics And Repair

## [Bitmain Test Fixture](https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=212) vs [Asic Repair Tester](https://tester.asic.repair/en) ("Russian" Tester)

Russian Tester (ARC):

1. You can swap between different models extremely fast, unlike Zeus universal tester where you need to flash the conversion file and change TF card each time you want to use a different model on the tester.
2. ARC is a "forever on" tester, you can slowly take your time and test the test point one by one yourself. Unlike Zeus tester, you need to press the test button and measure your test point within 1 minute.
3. ARC does not start hashing the hashboard at all, so you don't need a cooling fan while you are testing the test point.
4. ARC is extremely fast at testing the connection between chips and temp sensors.
5. ARC is powered by USB and only USB, you don't need to concern yourself with whether you need to power the Zeus tester with bench power supply or miner's power supply, ARC does not need the 4 pins voltage regulating line too.
6. Comes with a numbered ASIC chip web interface, very easy to see. It even tells you which chip the temp sensor is at.

What ARC doesn't do:

1. It does not do pattern testing.
2. It does not start hashing, so you cant test what happens when your hashboard heats up.
